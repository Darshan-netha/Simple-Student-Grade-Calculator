##  Project  Overview  
A Simple Student Grade Calculator that takes marks and returns grade (A, B, C, etc.) with encouraging messages for each grade
This project is developed as part of **Week 2** of my Data Science Internship at Developers Arena.  
The goal of this task is to build a **simple Student Grade Calculator** that accepts a student's marks and returns a grade along with an encouraging message.  

This project strengthens logical thinking, decision-making using conditional statements, and user-interaction handling in Python.
